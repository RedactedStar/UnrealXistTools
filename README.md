# P4 Tools

- [P4EncodePath.ps1](#p4encodepathps1)
  - Encode (or `-Decode`) paths for P4
- [P4ImportBulk.ps1](#p4importbulkps1)
  - Import a massive number of files into a new depot without breaking P4
    (tested by importing 800k+ files from UDN P4 `//UE5/Release-5.2`)


# UEngine.ps1

- By default selects the engine used by the current or named project
- `-List` lists all available custom engines
- `-Name` selects from available custom engines
- `-Project` selects the engine associated with the given .uproject


### Usage Examples

```powershell
UEngine.ps1 -List
```


# UProjectClean.ps1

- Delete all `Binaries` (generated data)
- Delete all `Intermediate` (generated data)
- Delete all `*.sln` (generated data)
- Delete all `.idea` (if you set `-Idea` switch)
- Delete all `DerivedDataCache` (if you set `-DDC` switch)
- Generate Project Files

### Usage Examples

Clean the project in the current directory:

```powershell
UProjectClean.ps1 -Debug
```

Clean a specific `MyGame.uproject`:

```powershell
UProjectClean.ps1 -Debug MyGame.uproject
```


# UProjectFile.ps1

Provides a default `$UProjectFile` based on the current directory.
If you do not explicitly set a -Path, it will auto-guess the
appropriate .uproject file in the current directory.

### Usage Examples

Set `$UProjectFile` to the current directory's default value.

```powershell
UProjectFile.ps1 -Debug
```

Set `$UProjectFile` to the default one in the `path/to/Project/` directory.

```powershell
UProjectFile.ps1 -Debug path/to/Project/
```

Set `$UProjectFile` to be a specific .uproject

```powershell
UProjectFile.ps1 -Debug path/to/Project/Name.uproject
```

# UProject.ps1

Returns JSON parsed contents of `$UProjectFile` as a PowerShell Object


# UnrealVersionSelector.ps1

- Allows developer to refer to `.uproject` files via relative paths
- Infers the name of `.uproject` files based on current directory
- Executes Epic's `UnrealVersionSelector.exe` for base functionality


### Usage Examples

#### Generate project files

```powershell
UnrealVersionSelector.ps1 -ProjectFiles
```

#### Choose which Engine to use

```powershell
UnrealVersionSelector.ps1 -SwitchVersion
```

##### Choose a Specific Engine

```powershell
UnrealVersionSelector.ps1 -SwitchVersionSilent /Project/Root/Engine/Binaries/../..
```

### Help

For more info see `UnrealVersionSelector.ps1 -help`


# P4EncodePath.ps1

Encodes or Decodes a P4 path.  See `-Help` for more details.


# P4ImportBulk.ps1

Import a massive number of files into a new depot without breaking P4.

As of Jan-2023 I am unable to get P4 to successfully import UDN in one commit.
Perhaps it is related to RAM availability?

With this script, I can break the 800k+ files into batches and submit those,
which works great.

See `-Help` for Usage.

PS- Maybe not required if parallel processing is enabled on your P4 server?
